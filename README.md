# Zebrafish_startle_response_identification

### This project relates to my dissertation project. Goal of this code is to identify fast startle response from individual adult zebrafish behavior videos. 

#### The basic principle of the code is to import a series of zebrafish behavior videos, then the code would identify the region of interest in the videos. Based on my experimental set up, the region of interest is a circular disk, therefore the imfindcircles() function in Matlab can easily detect the region of interest for the fish.
